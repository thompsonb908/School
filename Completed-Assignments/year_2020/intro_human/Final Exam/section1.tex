During our lecture we have defined many terms, seven of them will be defined here.\\
Humanities: As an intro to humanities class, the definition of humanities should be pretty important. From the course I believe it is the description of what being human is supposed to be. Of course this varies from person to person.\\
Culture: Culture is defined as the patterns of shared behavior or beliefs in a group. 
Modernity: Modernity is the definition of a generation about its own innovations and culture with the idea that previous generations are antiquated.\\
Utopia/Dystopia: A utopia is considered a 'perfect' society. Thus a dystopia is the opposite of a perfect society. We have seen in class that these tow concepts can often overlap, a utopia for some is a dystopia for others.\\
Posthumanism: Posthumanism is used as a critique of humanism for the changing understanding of our place in the natural world.\\
Panopticism: Derived from the panopticon building designed my Jeremy Bentham to watch many people at once with little manpower. The word is now synonymous with the principle of constant surveillance.\\
\textit{Homo faber}: Homo faber is the belief that humans are masters of their own fates or being their own 'maker'.
