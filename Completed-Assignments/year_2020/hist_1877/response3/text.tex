During the reconstruction, Andrew Johnson seemed to favor southerners in general, returning confiscated land, pardoning rebels and letting southerners reorganize their governments.
Because of this the souther whites were able to implement The Black Codes that simulated slavery.
The Black Codes stated that if a Africa American did not have an employer they could be sold to an employer forced to work for a contracted period of time.
Because of the Northerners animosity towards how Johnson was essentially putting the same southern people back into power, Congress took over the reconstruction.

After Congress took over the reconstruction, white southerners were not happy with how much power blacks had been given.
Whites combatted this with violence aimed at blacks and white Republicans. There would be large scale fights between Republicans and white led groups like the KKK over who would control the state government. The main goal of this violence was to lower the republican vote in the south so that Democratic leaders would be put back into power, and they were successful.

By 1877 all southern states had Democratic governments. Through violence and requiring literacy and residency test and voting taxes that blacks could not pay whites were able to disenfranchise African Americans and dominate the political direction of the south. This allowed the south to implement Jim Crow laws to further place African Americans back into subservient positions.
