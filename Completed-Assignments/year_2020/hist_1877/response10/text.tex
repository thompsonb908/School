Teddy Roosevelt is responsible for the ideology that the United States should intervene in the rest of the world.
Famously saying that the United States should ''speak softly and carry a big stick."
Teddy's ideology divided the world into "civilized" and ''uncivilized'' nations where it was the duty of the former to intervene with the latter.
Roosevelt believed that Europeans would take over Latin American countries like they had done with Africa, and we should defend these countries.

Woodrow Wilson continued Roosevelt's ideology in a different way.
He believed that America had a duty to spread freedom and democracy to other nations and the way to do that was through economic development.
Wilson spread the idea that it was ok to militarily intervene in other nations, so long as it was in the name of democracy and freedom.

During the first years of the war, Germans used submarine warfare to sink ships entering or leaving the UK.
After a passenger ship was sunk by Germans in 1915, the United States started preparing for war.
America also had stronger economic ties to Britain.
In 1917 Germany began using submarines on neutral ships, as well as sending a message to Mexico that if they joined Germany against the United States, they would receive back the land that they had lost.
Soon after the telegram, Congress declared war on the Central Powers.
