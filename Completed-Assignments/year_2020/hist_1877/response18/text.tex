The Cold War was a feud between the United States and the Soviet Union over the worlds ideological future.
The bombing of Japan showed that the United States were the most powerful nation in the world.
This scared the Soviet Union and they rushed to create their own bombs.
The Allies did not trust one another, Britain and the US did not trust the Soviets and the Soviets did not trust the West.
The US remembered Stalin's alliance with Hitler and did not accept the Soviet dominance of Eastern Europe.
The Soviets believed that the US had purposefully delayed its invasion of France and resented that the atomic bomb had been kept secret from them.
The Soviets were afraid of the US and were still traumatized from the experience of World War II.

After the War, George Kennan sent a document to the Truman administration advising how to deal with the Soviets.
Kennan argued that the goal of the Soviets was to spread Communist ideology and nothing would stop them from trying.
Kennan also believed that the US did not have the power to rollback Soviet power and should instead stop the spread and they would collapse from within.
