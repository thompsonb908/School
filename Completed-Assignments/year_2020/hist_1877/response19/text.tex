The US government treated the Cold War as it would a \textquote(hot) war.
The government funded propaganda to convince Americans it was worth fighting.
Much of the propaganda was secretly funded or encouraged by the CIA.

According to the American government, the Soviet Union and communism were evil, making America and its allies the \textquote(good) guys.
The soviet system was defined as \textquote(totalitarian,) seeking to subdue all of society to its will.
Because totalitarian governments control everything, there was no way for it to change from within.
This was scary for the American public to think about because of our beliefs about freedom of speech and such.
Americans feared any idea that was somewhat similar to communism, politicians accused opponents of being communists to de-legitimize their claims.

Overall there was a lot of propaganda against communism and how it could take over America if it was allowed within the borders.
Another major contributing factor was the Soviets developing their own atomic weaponry.
Now not only did Americans have to be on the lookout for any of their neighbors that acted suspicious, but they also had to worry about the Soviets destroying cities with nuclear bombs.
The general feeling of Americans during the Cold War was fear.
