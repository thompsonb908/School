Charles A.\ Lindbergh was the first person to complete a solo, non-stop, trans-Atlantic flight, and used his fame to promote isolationism as a spokesperson for the America First Committee.
In Lindbergh's \textquote{America First} speech, he uses the policies of Washington and the Monroe Doctrine as past examples of isolationism that have guided the United States to be the best nation in the world, saying \textquote{It is a policy that led this nation to success during the most trying years of our history, and it is a policy that will lead us to success again.}

Lindbergh believes that the focus of the United States should be inward, to build up the nations defenses and concentrate military power around the United States.
The main argument proposed is that the United States is very distant from these nations taking part in the war, this makes it difficult for America to send supplies and troops to aid other countries.
Whatever difficulties we face with sending aid, the Nazi's will face if attempting to attack the United States, such as transporting millions of troops, ammunition and military vehicles and landing on foreign, hostile territory.
The ideas presented in this document resonated with many Americans who had suffered through the Great Depression and believed that getting caught in global war would ruin our already fragile economy.
