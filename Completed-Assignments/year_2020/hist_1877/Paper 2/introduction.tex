Between 1929 to 1941, America struggled through the Great Depression, foreign affairs took a backseat to economic survival.
America imposed high tariffs on imported goods in order to encourage manufacturers to produce more and help the economy.
This further reduced Americas relations with other nations.

On September 18, 1931, Japan blew up one of their own railways and framed anti-Japanese Chinese dissidents as a basis for invading China.
Japan began a full scale invasion of China on July 7, 1937 and routed the Chinese National Revolutionary Army.
Chinese leaders appealed to the League of Nations for assistance against Japan.
But, while the United States disapproved of Japanese aggression, they offered no support to China.
While some Americans wished to help China, Japan's more technologically advanced and larger military, coupled with America still dealing with an economic crisis prevented any aid from the United States.
