For the Japanese World War 2 started a deacde before the involvement of The United States and the bombing of Pearl Harbor.
After a Japanese-owned railway in China exploded, a ruse for Japan to take action against China, the Japanese invaded and captured Manchuria.
After three years of political crises, Japan committed itself to aggressive military expansion.
Japan isolated itself from the world, empowering radical military leaders to take over Japanese policy.
The Japanese began a full scale invasion of China that lasted between July 7 to December 13, 1937.
The invasion of China and the treatment of Chinese prisoners of war was particularly brutal, China lobbied the League of Nations for aid against the Japanese invasion to no avail.
Americans read about the fighting in China, but the United States lacked both the will and military power to oppose the Japanese invasion.
Even if some Americans wanted to help the Chinese, the American military was not as technologically advanced or as numerous as the Japanese was.
Chinese Nationalists continued to lobby Washington for aid, and while the United States did not approve of Japanese actions, it did not offer any aid to China.
The isolationist views of Americans prolonged World War II unnecessarily and allowed Axis powers to cement their holdings in other countries more than if the United States had joined earlier.
