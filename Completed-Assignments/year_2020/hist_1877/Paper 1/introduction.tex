After the Civil War, most of the South in ruins.
This goes for both the structure, roads and buildings, as well as the Souths way of life.
There was a lot of uncertainty about what to do with the South after the war.
Would the South be considered conquered states or equal states?
How would they rebuild their governments, economies and social systems?
What rights would former slaves have?
This period of time was known as the Reconstruction, appropriately named for how the United States restored the South to the Union and redefined African Americans' place in society.
This paper compares primary sources from the Reconstruction era describing the rights of African Americans and methods white southerns used to try and restore antebellum order as much as they could.
