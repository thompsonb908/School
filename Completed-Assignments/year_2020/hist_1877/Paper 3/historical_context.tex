The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) was always looking to improve the standing of African Americans, gathering enough funds to tackle the \textquote{separate but equal} issue since the \textquote{Plessy v. Ferguson} case.
The Legal Defence Fund (LDF) of the NAACP was looking for cases that they could use to take the issue to the supreme court, choosing cases from Virginia, Delaware, South Carolina, Kansas, and the District of Columbia.
These cases were all opposed to the conditions of segregated schools, often without proper heating/cooling, course materials and understaffed and overcrowded.
