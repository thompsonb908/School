In many ways World War 2 was not won from Axis powers on the battlefield, but from the application of cutting edge technologies and labor organizing techniques to create more war materials than anyone else.
The main contribution of America to WW2 was the amount of production.
The US was responsible for the production of 324,000 military aircraft, as opposed to 279,000 from all of the other Axis powers combined, 2.4 million trucks were produced by the US, compared to 1.2 million from the rest of the world.
In the end, Germany could not keep up with the amount of stuff being produced.

Every American was directly effected by the war.
16 million Americans served in the armed forces which was a large amount considering the population at the time.
Those that were not in the military had either a relative or close friend who was, had a job change because of the war, experienced rationing, and a shortage of consumer goods.
People that built cars now built tanks, those that worked in railroads were under military direction to transport war goods, and women and blacks were allowed to work in jobs they previously could not apply to.
