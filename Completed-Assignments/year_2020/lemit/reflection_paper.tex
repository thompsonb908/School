\doublespacing
	The group that I interned with this semester was the City of
	Haines City Technology Management Department. The department currently consists
	of a group of four individuals and myself who's task was to aid the city's
	transition from a fully paper workplace to a mostly digital workplace.
	A lot of that work had already been done before I was added to the team, but there
	is still a lot more work left before it is finished. The Technology Management Department
	oversees all of the city's other departments and multiple buildings around the Haines
	City area for all of their computer, cybersecurity and network issues.

	During this internship my main goal was to update the Technology Management Departments
	inventory to include the most recent information possible, remove any errors in the
	inventory, and possibly transition the inventory from an Excel Data sheet to a Microsoft
	Access relational database. Other projects assigned to me were a cost based analysis for
	implementing a event and log manager for the city's wide-area network. Microsoft Visual
	Basic coding to manage group policies and write the input forms for the inventory database.
	Basic desktop support, basic printer support, researching and ordering of new phones,
	network switches and routers, wireless access points and desktop and laptop computers.
	Written a standard operating procedure for collecting information on inventory items,
	and the proper use of Microsoft Access. The training class for Microsoft Access is still
	in development.

	Part of my goals for the internship were to have written a standard operating procedure
	and a cost-based analysis, both of these priorities have been met. However because of
	recent events with the outbreak of COVID-19 and the need for social distancing, there
	have been some changes to the priorities at Haines City. Namely collecting as many of
	the laptops as possible and getting them in working order for employees to be able to work
	from home. So I was not able to accomplish all of my objectives during this internship,
	however I have gained valuable insights to the inner workings and operations of government
	entities, the need for documentation of procedures and disaster planning in the Information
	Technology field. As you can see the goals that have been set for this internship have
	been met and surpassed within the semester, however I plan to continue this internship
	through the summer and until they no longer have need of me or my courses become to
	difficult to support a job and classwork.

	The Microsoft Access database is a SQL database that uses Microsoft's Visual Basic
	for Applications to create forms for viewing, accessing, and editing records within
	the database. The database links multiple tables to provide the most information
	about an inventory item while limiting the amount of unnecessary records that are
	inherit in a single table database. This database was planned only for the Technology
	Management Department, but expansion of the database to include multiple departments
	would not take too much more effort.

	The inventory management standard operating procedure contains information for how to
	identify the type of inventory item is being documented, where the information is
	located on the device. The document details how to locate the correct information
	like serial numbers, MAC addresses, phone numbers, IP addresses, the employee
	the device had been assigned to and other necessary information. The document
	includes pictures of tags with the correct information labeled and commands to
	find activation keys if the device requires.

	The cost-based analysis used quotes from multiple companies for an
	event and log analysis software to determine server downtime, errors, suspicious
	activity and to be compliant with government regulations to hold log files for an
	extended amount of time. The implementation of the chosen event manager would give
	the city more security and real-time control over their network operation. It would
	also make the Technology Management Department more aware of systems that are
	malfunctioning, or are close to the end-of-life of the device.

	Basic support of desktops, phones and printers has increased my understanding of the
	Windows operating system, specifically version 7, 8 and 10, as well as Xerox and Dell
	printer setup, maintenance and repair. Computer systems can be made to work with
	just about any device, all that matters is what data can be accepted and what data
	is pushed out. Learning about these topics has shown me the even though a system is
	extremely complicated, the process should be automatic and not interfere with the
	users work in the slightest (or they will complain).

	Lastly, the need for disaster preparedness was very apparent during the COVID-19
	outbreak, this unique situation was handled as well as possible by the Technology 
	Management Department. The process included documenting all of the available laptops
	currently available and tracking down laptops that were not being used in other
	departments. After collecting as many laptops and their accessories (chargers, keyboards)
	the storage had to be cleaned out, all unnecessary software removed and all necessary
	software updated or installed for the users.

	My internship correlated with my coursework through project management, database design,
	coding fundamentals, and computer network fundamentals. Project management was a large
	part of this internship because everything has a deadline and managing multiple projects
	can get difficult at times. Database design was imperative for the Microsoft Access
	inventory database that I have been designing. Coding fundamentals were also used 
	for the form design for the inventory database using Microsoft Visual Basic for
	applications. A basic understanding of networks is useful when installing network hardware
	such as firewalls, routers, switches and wireless access points.

	During this internship I gathered a few general lessons that I will carry with me as I
	transition into my working career. Everything is, and should be, documented. Even if it
	does not seem important in the moment, later when you need to locate an item, see what
	was changed, need a phone number, or the proper procedure to complete a task. Documenting
	what happened, when it happened and the steps taken will help protect you from liability,
	and help others who follow behind you know what you did to get there. Time management
	is very important in the workplace, sometimes you need to prioritize a project because
	the deadline is before all of the other ones, but you cannot neglect the others either.
	Everything is more complicated than it seems, someone that is not part of the department
	will not understand most of what goes on in another department. Working in the Technology
	Management Department which overseas all of the other departments technology needs, you
	have to be able to ask the right questions to be able to correlate the correct information
	between what the computer wants and what the user wants. Security should always be a top
	priority, if something is implemented and documented as being a security issue there
	will be serious repercussions if the security flaw was taken advantage of.
