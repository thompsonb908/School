	The internet of things is an architecture of devices that communicate between 
	each other and other services. This results in the generation of enormous amounts
	of data which has to be stored, processed and presented in a seamless, efficient,
	and easily interpreted form. \cite{gubbi} A simple IoT architecture is composed
	of sensors that collect data and send it to a database, the database retrieves
	and compiles necessary information and the user interface and displays this information
	to the user in as close to real time as possible.

	In 2016 Ronen et al \cite{ronen} classified attacks on IoT architectures into four groups,
	ignoring functionality, reducing functionality, misusing functionality and extending
	functionality. The main focus of the paper was to show an extended functionality attack
	on smart lights to leak data from secure locations or cause epileptic people to have
	seizures. This assumes that there is already an infected computer and the attacker is
	using the lights to retrieve the compromised data. This attack is a major breach in
	integrity and availability because the attacker can turn the light on or off, removing
	the availability of the light(s) or it could have a larger impact on the system by providing
	an channel for compromised data to escape from the would be extremely difficult to trace.

	Williams et al \cite{williams} conducted a large scale Nessus vulnerability scan on 156,680
	consumer IoT devices and found that 12\% of these devices contained a vulnerability of
	'critical', 'high', 'medium' or 'low' risk. The devices scanned were webcams, smart TV's
	and printers that were considered part of an IoT infrastructure. This means that 12\% of
	consumer IoT devices could be susceptible to attacks. Considering the number of devices
	is expected to grow by 21 percent annually, rising to 18 billion between 2016 and 2022
	\cite{ericson}
	this percentage is not acceptable and could cause major security issues or data breaches
	in the future if companies do not improve the security of their IoT devices.

	In general, IoT is still fairly new as a technology, and its benefits are still being
	developed, but as people are developing new methods to utilize the IoT, they are not
	considering the confidentiality, integrity, or availability flaws of their system.
	Cisco released a video on their Youtube channel \cite{cisco} about the anatomy of an
	IoT attack and how attackers could use an unsecure device to gain access to more critical
	systems.
