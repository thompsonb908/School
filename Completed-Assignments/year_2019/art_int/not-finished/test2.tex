	\begin{enumerate}
		\item In the game tree of a two-player turn-taking game, the root is game state after the first player has made the first movement. F
		\item While guiding a computer to play a two-player turn-taking game, the evaluation function is used to evaluate all nodes within a game tree. F
		\item While guiding a computer to play a two-player turn-taking game, exhaustively searching a game tree is not necessary. T
		\item While guiding a computer to play a two-player turn-taking game, cutting off the search of the game tree only at quiescent postilions is a good way to prevent the horizon problem. F
		\item The alpha-beta pruning will cut a branch from a game tree, if the move along that branch is determined to be worse than another move that has been examined already. T
		\item In the worst case, the alpha-beta pruning will not cut any branch from the game tree at all. T
		\item Search can be used to solve problems that are limited by constraints. T
		\item Forward checking can be used to delete impossible future choices while solving 8-queens problem. T
		\item Chronological backtracking is suitable for solving constraint satisfaction problems. F
		\item The least constraint variable is a good technology to speed up the search of constraint satisfaction problems. F
		\item Meta-heuristics are heuristics that are used to guide other heuristics. T
		\item Tabu search is a meta-heuristic that would prefer a poor path than repeating a visited path. T
		\item Ant colony optimization has been successfully applied in routing cables through a communication network. T
		\item Simulated annealing tends to accept a new state that has higher energy than the current state, if the increase of energy is high. F
		\item In terms of decision trees, entropy is the indication of how much a data set is purified. F
		\item In terms of decision trees, the information gain is represented as entropy reduction. T
		\item In a rule based system, the fact base is like a human's long term memory. F
		\item While designing an expert system, the knowledge engineer is responsible for writing meta-rules.T
		\item In terms of expert systems, meta-rules might have a lower priority than ordinary rules. F
		\item The Rete algorithm is an efficient method to speed up the comparisons between the left-hand side of rules and the contents in the fact base. T

	Given the following game tree, apply minimax algorithm with alpha beta pruning to mark branches that need to be pruned.
