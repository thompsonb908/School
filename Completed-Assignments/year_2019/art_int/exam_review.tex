	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Depth-First search is a complete search method. F
		\item Space complexity of a search method cannot be represented by the big-O notation. F
		\item Steepest ascent hill climbing wont be trapped by a local optimal solution. F
		\item The best-first search will never miss the goal, if there is one. T
		\item An admissible heuristic might overestimate the come of moving from a given state to the goal state. F
		\item In a semantic net, the links represent objects and the nodes represent relationships between those objects. F
		\item A good frame knowledge representation can be easily translated into first order predicate knowledge and be managed by rule-based system. F
		\item Inheritance allows us to specify properties of a super class and then define a subclass to inherit the properties from its super class. T
		\item A frame system consists of a set of frame that are connected together by slot values. T
		\item Frames are object-oriented knowledge representation that can be used to build intelligent systems. T
		\item The semantic net approach allows all information about a particular object to be stored together. F
		\item In frame knowledge representation, a when-needed procedure will run automatically. F
		\item By applying goal reduction, a given problem can be represented as a goal tree which will lead to a none-recursive solution. F
		\item Goal driven inference tends to infer more than necessary. F
		\item The Chinese room experiment was designed to promote the idea of strong AI. F
		\item the followers of weak AI believe that a computer can fall in love with a human. F
		\item Strong method problem solving depends on the weak method. T
		\item The expert system shell is an implementation of weak method. T
		\item In the early history of AI, the General Problem Solver (GPS) was an attempt to use strong methods to solve a wide range of general problems. F
		\item The propositional and predicate logic off logical reason are based on the logic invented by Aristotle. T
