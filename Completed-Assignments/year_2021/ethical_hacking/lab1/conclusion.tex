During this lab we learned about configuring the Windows Firewall.
The firewall monitors three types of networks, Domain, Public and Private.
In Part A we disabled all incoming connections on the \textbf{Public} network to improve security, and validated this in the \textbf{Advanced Settings} menu.
The Windows firewall is both application and rule based.
You can disallow a specific application or create a rule that disables communication ports, stopping programs from communicating beyond the computer.
In Part B we disable port 80, corresponding to unsecured web communication using HTTP.
We then validated that the rule was working by visiting websites using HTTP and HTTPS.
With the rule enabled we were unable to connect to any website using HTTP.
