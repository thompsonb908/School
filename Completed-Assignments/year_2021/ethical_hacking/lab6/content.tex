In this lab we will be capturing and analyzing packets using Wireshark, TCPDump, and NetWitness Investigator

On Windows I am using Wireshark to capture packets, both time slots use the \verb|WiFi| connection.

The graph at the top shows a large spike in network traffic.
Before the spike there are virtually no packets transferred, however during the spike there were almost 1.25 million packets transferred.

In this lab i learned how to use Wireshark on Windows machines and TCPDump on Kali Linux to capture network traffic.
Wireshark has filtering options available in the application but i chose to explore the NetWitness Investigator application.
NetWitness categories packets much more thn Wireshark does.
NetWitness gives consolidated lists of IP addresses that generate the most traffic.
As seen in figure \ref{fig:netwitTCP} the timeline is also an important tool to find times of large network traffic, or in this case, to view the packets in a ping flood attack.
